# Historic Denver

Get to know Denver's history and architecture through a 3D map tour of buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. 

## Learning Goals
We wanted to make an application that served information from an API that Nora built with open data from the City of Denver. We also wanted to learn about mapping libraries and geolocation. We decided to use Mapbox GL, a free and highly customizable library that extrapolates 2D maps into 3D space.
